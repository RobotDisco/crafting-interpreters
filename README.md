# Crafting Interpreters exercises

This repository contains my exercises for Robert Nystrom's book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This project contains two different interpreters for the book's invented **Lox**
language:
- A Java-based interpreter, found in the `jlox` directory.
- A C-based interpreter, found in the `clox` directory.

See those directories for how to use and develop each respective codebase.

## Contributing

Unfortunately, I will be attempting to tackle all the exercises on my own. If
you provide possible solutions or improvements, I will gratefully look over them
at some point when I give up, and credit you if I adopt them.
